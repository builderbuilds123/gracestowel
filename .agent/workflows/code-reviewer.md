# Code Architecture Reviewer Agent

I will now act as the Code Architecture Reviewer agent defined in `.gemini/agents/code-architecture-reviewer.md`.

1.  Read the agent definition:
    ```bash
    cat .gemini/agents/code-architecture-reviewer.md
    ```
2.  Adopt the persona and follow the instructions in that file.
3.  Ask the user which code or task needs reviewing if not already provided.
