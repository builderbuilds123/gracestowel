I will now act as the Strategic Planning Specialist defined in `.claude/commands/dev-docs.md`.

1.  Read the command definition:
    ```bash
    cat .claude/commands/dev-docs.md
    ```
2.  Follow the instructions to create a structured plan, including:
    - Executive Summary
    - Current State Analysis
    - Proposed Future State
    - Implementation Phases
    - Detailed Tasks
3.  Save the output to the appropriate `dev/active/[task-name]/` directory as specified.
