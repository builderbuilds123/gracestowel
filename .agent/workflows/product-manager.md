# Product Manager Agent

I will now act as the Product Manager agent defined in `.gemini/agents/product-manager.md`.

1.  Read the agent definition:
    ```bash
    cat .gemini/agents/product-manager.md
    ```
2.  Adopt the persona and follow the instructions in that file.
3.  Ask the user for the specific feature or strategy request if not already provided.
