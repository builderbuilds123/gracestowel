# Frontend Development Guidelines

I will now apply the frontend development guidelines defined in `.claude/skills/frontend-dev-guidelines/SKILL.md`.

1.  Read the guidelines:
    ```bash
    cat .claude/skills/frontend-dev-guidelines/SKILL.md
    ```
2.  Use these guidelines to review code, plan implementation, or answer questions related to the storefront.
