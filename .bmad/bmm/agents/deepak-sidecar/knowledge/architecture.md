# System Architecture

<!--
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USER:
Populate this file with your system's architecture documentation.
Deepak will load this on activation to understand component relationships during debugging.

Suggested sections:
-->

## High-Level Overview

<!-- Describe your system at a high level -->
<!-- Example: "Monorepo with React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database" -->

## Component Diagram

<!-- ASCII diagram or description of main components and their relationships -->

## Service Map

<!-- List your services/apps and their responsibilities -->
<!-- Example:
- **apps/storefront** - Next.js e-commerce frontend
- **apps/backend** - Medusa.js backend API
- **apps/e2e** - Playwright end-to-end tests
-->

## Data Flow

<!-- How does data flow through your system? -->
<!-- Example: User request -> Frontend -> API -> Database -> Response -->

## External Dependencies

<!-- Third-party services, APIs, databases -->
<!-- Example:
- Cloudflare Workers (edge computing)
- Railway (hosting)
- Stripe (payments)
-->

## Critical Paths

<!-- The most important user journeys that must always work -->
<!-- Example:
1. User authentication flow
2. Checkout process
3. Order fulfillment
-->

## Known Weak Points

<!-- Areas that tend to break or need extra attention during debugging -->
