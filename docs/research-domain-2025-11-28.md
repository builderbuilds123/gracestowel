## 1. Research Objectives and Methodology

### Research Objectives
The primary objective is to deconstruct the "Bath Towel" product category to empower consumers to make informed purchasing decisions. Specifically:
1.  **Demystify Quality:** Translate technical specifications (GSM, twist, staple length) into tangible user benefits (softness, absorbency, durability).
2.  **Identify Value:** Determine the "sweet spot" for quality vs. price—what features are worth paying for, and which are marketing fluff.
3.  **Guide Selection:** Create a framework for identifying durable, high-performance towels suitable for family use.

### Scope and Boundaries
*   **Product Category:** Bath Towels (Standard and Bath Sheets).
*   **Materials:** Focus on Cotton varieties (Egyptian, Turkish, Pima, Upland) and popular blends (Cotton/Bamboo, Cotton/Poly).
*   **Construction:** Analysis of weave types (Terry, Waffle, Velour) and loop construction (Zero-twist, Combed, Ring-spun).
*   **Key Metrics:**
    *   **GSM (Grams per Square Meter):** Weight and density implications.
    *   **Absorbency:** Factors affecting moisture wicking and retention.
    *   **Durability:** Hemming standards, color fastness, and laundry resilience.
*   **Exclusions:** We will exclude purely decorative towels or ultra-niche luxury fibers (e.g., linen, silk) unless relevant for comparison.
