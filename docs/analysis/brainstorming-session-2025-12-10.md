## Phase 2: Cross-Pollination

### Industry 1: Custom Jewelry & Personalization

**Key Insight:** Large-scale companies vertically integrate manufacturing + customization under one factory
- **Pattern:** Eliminate multi-step logistics by combining processes
- **Adaptation for Towels:** Could you find an embroidery factory that also sources/stocks towels?
- **Benefit:** Single vendor, simplified logistics, better quality control
### Industry 2: Print-on-Demand (T-shirts, Books)

**Patterns Analyzed:**
- **Consolidation:** Not viable at current scale, future consideration
- **Regional hubs:** Customization requires China-based processing; Canadian hub would add cost, not reduce
- **Shipping tiers:** ✅ EXPRESS SHIPPING option - viable immediate opportunity

**Key Adaptation:** Offer tiered shipping (economy vs. express) to capture different customer segments
### Industry 3: Electronics & Tech Accessories

**Patterns Analyzed:**
- **Packaging optimization:** 
  - ✅ Vacuum sealing for dimension limits (even if under 2kg weight)
  - ✅ Recyclable plastic already planned for weight reduction
- **Weight splitting:** ✅ Automatic order splitting if cost-effective
- **Alternative carriers:** More expensive than ePacket, but research needed for >2kg solutions

**Key Adaptations Identified:**
1. Vacuum sealing for dimensional compliance
2. Smart order splitting algorithm based on cost analysis
3. Tiered shipping options (economy/express)
## Phase 3: Decision Tree Mapping

### Primary Decision Tree: Order Processing Flow

**Decision Point 1: Order Type**
- Standard towel → Direct ship (ePacket if <2kg)
- Custom embroidery → Multi-step process

**Decision Point 2: ePacket Eligibility Check**
- Weight <2kg AND dimensions within limits → ePacket
- Exceeds either limit → Split order OR alternative carrier

**Decision Point 3: Shipping Options**
- Economy: ePacket or split packages
- Express: Dynamic API pricing for premium option

**Decision Point 4: Packaging Method**
- Standard: Recyclable plastic bags
- Optimized: Vacuum sealing for dimension compliance
