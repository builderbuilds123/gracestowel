# Why We Don't Stalk You (The "Cookie" Talk) 🍪🚫

Okay, raise your hand if this has happened to you:

You look at *one* pair of boots online. Just one look! And suddenly, those boots are following you everywhere. They’re in your Instagram feed, they’re in the sidebar of your news site, they’re practically knocking on your front door asking why you haven't bought them yet. 👢👀

It’s creepy, right?

That’s the work of **Third-Party Cookies**. And I want to talk about why most websites love them, and why we decided to ban them from our site completely.

## What is a "Cookie" Anyway? (Not the Chocolate Chip Kind)

Think of a cookie like a digital nametag.

*   **First-Party Cookies (The Good Kind):** These are helpful! They’re the reason your shopping cart doesn't empty itself every time you click a new page. They help our site remember, "Oh hey, it's you! You were looking at the bath sheets." It stays *between us*.
*   **Third-Party Cookies (The Gossip):** These are the ones we don't use. These are little trackers dropped by ad companies (you know the ones). They follow you from site to site, taking notes on everything you do, and then sell that info to advertisers.

## Why Do Other Sites Use Them? 💸

Short answer: Money.

Most websites let these trackers in because it helps them serve you "targeted ads." They trade your privacy for the chance to annoy you into buying something you looked at three weeks ago. It’s the standard way the internet works right now, but honestly? It feels a little bit like being spied on.

## Why We Don't Do That Here 🙅‍♀️

When we built this site, we made a choice: **We sell towels, not your data.**

We believe your bathroom habits (and your shopping habits) are your business. When you browse our site, we want you to feel like you’re in a peaceful, private boutique—not a crowded mall with salespeople following you around with clipboards.

*   **No creepy trackers.**
*   **No selling your info.**
*   **Just really, really good towels.**

So go ahead, browse in peace. Look at that waffle weave towel as many times as you want. We won't tell the rest of the internet about it. We promise. 🛁✨
