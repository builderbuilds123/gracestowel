# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-11-30
**Facilitator:** AI Facilitator Antigravity
**Participant:** Grace

## Session Start

User selected to focus on the **SCAMPER Method** to systematically innovate on feature ideas.

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Feature Ideas

**Session Goals:** Explore and generate new feature ideas for the Gracestowel project.

**Techniques Used:** SCAMPER Method

**Total Ideas Generated:** 2

### Key Themes Identified:

- **Radical Transparency:** Showing the true cost and value.
- **Direct Social Impact:** Making every purchase matter.

## Technique Sessions

### SCAMPER Method

#### Substitute

- **Dynamic Transparent Pricing:** Substitute fixed pricing with a fully transparent, real-time breakdown of costs (materials, labor, shipping, fees, marketing, taxes, profit). Prices adjust dynamically based on actual costs (e.g., manufacturer deals, server traffic).

#### Combine

- **Charity API Integration:** Combine the checkout process with real-time donations (e.g., Tree Nation API). Users can see their purchase instantly trigger a positive impact (e.g., "You just planted 5 trees").



## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities

_Ideas ready to implement now_

### Immediate Opportunities

_Ideas ready to implement now_
